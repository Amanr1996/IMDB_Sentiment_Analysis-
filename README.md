#**IMDB Sentiment Analysis Project**

This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews using natural language processing techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify reviews as either positive or negative based on the text content.

**Data**
The data used in this project is a publicly available dataset of movie reviews from IMDb. It consists of 50,000 reviews, split evenly between positive and negative reviews. The dataset is preprocessed and formatted in a way that makes it easy to use for machine learning tasks.

**Methodology*
The project uses a variety of natural language processing techniques to extract features from the text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization. These features are then fed into a machine learning model, specifically a logistic regression classifier, which is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on a separate test set. The final model is then used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews.

**Requirements**
To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* nltk




**Results**
The final model achieved an accuracy of *0.8335* the test set, indicating that it is able to effectively predict the sentiment of new reviews. However, there may be some room for improvement, and future work could involve experimenting with different feature extraction techniques or model architectures.

**Credits**
This project was developed by Aman. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and the natural language processing techniques were implemented using the scikit-learn and NLTK libraries.

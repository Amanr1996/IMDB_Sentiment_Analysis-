**IMDB Sentiment Analysis Project**

This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews using natural language processing techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify reviews as either positive or negative based on the text content.

**Data** 

The data used in this project is a publicly available dataset of movie reviews from IMDb. It consists of 50,000 reviews, split evenly between positive and negative reviews. The dataset is preprocessed and formatted in a way that makes it easy to use for machine learning tasks.

**Methodology**

The project uses a variety of natural language processing techniques to extract features from the text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization. These features are then fed into a machine learning model, specifically a logistic regression classifier, which is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on a separate test set. The final model is then used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews.

**Requirements**

To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* nltk

**Classifiers**

The following Naive Bayes classifiers were evaluated on the dataset:

* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Multinomial Naive Bayes
* Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Each classifier was trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set. The evaluation metric used was accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly classified examples.


**Results**
The accuracy scores for each classifier are as follows:

* Gaussian Naive Bayes: 0.6435

* Multinomial Naive Bayes: 0.8305

* Bernoulli Naive Bayes: 0.8335es.

Based on these results, it appears that the Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier performs slightly better than the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on this particular dataset. However, it's worth noting that the difference in accuracy between the two classifiers is relatively small.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this project shows that the choice of Naive Bayes classifier can have a significant impact on classification performance, depending on the nature of the dataset and the specific task at hand. While the Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier appears to perform slightly better than the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on this dataset, further experimentation and evaluation may be necessary to determine which classifier is truly the most effective.

**Credits**
This project was developed by Aman. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and the natural language processing techniques were implemented using the scikit-learn and NLTK libraries.
